    "In this example, `my_list` is a list object. When it is passed to the `modify_list()` function, a reference to the list is passed as an argument. Inside the function, the list is modified by appending the value 4 to it. The modification affects the original list object, so when we print `my_list` outside the function, it reflects the changes made inside the function.\n",

    "To summarize, Python is neither strictly pass by value nor pass by reference. Immutable objects are effectively passed by value, while mutable objects are effectively passed by reference, where modifications made to the object within the function are visible outside the function. Understanding this behavior is important for correctly working with function arguments in Python."
